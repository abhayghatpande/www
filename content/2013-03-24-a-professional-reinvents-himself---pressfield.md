> A professional reinvents himself...the professional does not permit himself to become hidebound within one incarnation, however comfortable or successful. Like a transmigrating soul, he shucks his outworn body and dons a new one. He continues his journey. <cite>Steven Pressfield, The War of Art</cite>
